<p style="font-size:16px">Welcome to Maxine Davis Glass Art! Maxine Davis is a local Vermont artist who creates beautiful works of art using bold colors and a glass medium. <br /><br /></p>
<p><em>"Color is my passion and glass is my medium. It explodes onto glass canvases (panels), bowls, clocks, drawer knobs/drawer pulls, masks, cityscapes, jewelry and anything that fusible glass can become."</em><br /><br /></p>
<p style="text-align:center">All works are handmade. <br /></p>
